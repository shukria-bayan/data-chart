<p>  Dozens of Afghan citizens demonstrated in front of the United Nations building in New York on Monday, with protestors chanting a trio of pleas: “Stop Hazara Genocide,” “Hazara lives matter!” and “UN, wake up!”Protesters demanded to recognize the systematic attacks against the Hazara ethnicity in Afghanistan. And an end to the “Genocide of Hazaras in Afghanistan.”   </p>

<p>Mehrjo Amini, 45, one of the organizers said “Our request is that Australia, Europe, and America follow a policy to prevent vulnerable communities that are in danger of being destroyed." </p>

<p>Demonstrators from different cities came to New York to raise their voices. “I left Afghanistan 30 years ago because of war against Hazara. The Enemy occupied our house and land. The Hazara Genocide started a long time ago and yet the world is silent,” said Hakima Gizabi,55, who came from Maryland.</p>

<p>On September 30, a terrorist armed with explosives entered the Kaaj education center in West Kabul. He killed the guard and then set off the detonator, blowing himself up along with hundreds of teenagers – Hazara girls and boys – who were receiving tutoring for their university entrance exam. Latest reports confirm 53 deaths, at least 46 of them girls, leaving another 110 injured. </p>

<p>Following this attack in western Kabul, millions of Afghan users have launched a "Stop Hazara Genocide" campaign on social networks. The hashtag of the “Stop Hazara genocide” has been twitted more than 10 million times. The demonstration has been held in more than 90 countries and cities around the world.</p>

<p>
Demonstrators read a resolution in all these demonstrations. The demonstrators asked for a fact-finding commission to investigate targeted attacks on Hazaras and that the UN and international community recognize the genocide in Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>Stephane Dujarric the UN spokesperson said, “we know the Hazara people have been targeted. It is the responsibility of the de facto authorities to ensure the protection of all people, including and especially vulnerable minorities.” </p>
